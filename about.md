<img src="https://worldofpiggy.github.io/img/profile_small.jpg" width="350px"/> Here I am, Francesco (and his invisible mate Piggy). I come from southern Italy and currently live somewhere in rainy Belgium, in a room full of books, interesting problems and (often) their solutions. I deal with data, math, stats, and computers, and I make things. 
Technologies I am excited about include Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Programming and Machine Learning.

I see science in every day life. I just love it!


# My story

Feel free to take some time to get to know me.

So, let's get serious. Or should we? 

I am Francesco Gadaleta, Ph.D – Data Scientist and Machine Learning expert. I worked as clinical data scientist at Gasthuisberg Research Hospital (Belgium) and I am currently data scientist in the Advanced Analytics Team of Johnson&Johnson.

I received my first computer back in 1988, and at the age of 7 (seven) I started exploring the quite limited capabilities of the [GW-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC) language. As no VGA support was provided I switched to the more powerful [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C), which I kept writing for the next 25 years. The passion for math and computer programming has been driving my career ever since. 

There are three major periods that formed me: **the Academic**, **the Pragmatic** and **the Domestic**.

## The Academic Period
I graduated in Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics) MSc. at Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and developed an autonomous hexapod robot that could see and avoid obstacles without stereoscopic vision. Cameras at that time were pretty expensive.

Then I got admitted to the PhD program at the University of Leuven, that I completed developing virtualization based solutions to protect operating systems from **serious** attacks to their kernel. During that period I have been travelling extensively around the world to present some hypervisor-based innovative approaches to computer security, some of which became core technology at VMWare. 
Here is my [dissertation](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/413219/1/phd+dissertation.pdf).

Then the passion for applied sciences made the switch from computer security to genomics.
As former member of the Statistical Genetics Unit at the Montefiore Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Liège, I have been involved in the FNRS Granted Integromics project with the purpose of finding solutions to integrate heterogeneous data (OMICS) within a common framework. In the aformentioned project I could assemble networks and merge clinical and genetic data together to make predictions about the risk of diseases for patients before the disease could be observed by known symptoms. 



## The Pragmatic Period

As data scientist at the Department of Human Genetics at the University Hospital UZ Leuven, I focused on the analysis of array CGH and Next Generation Sequencing data in molecular diagnostics. I have been specifically involved in the [NIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis) (Non-Invasive-Prenatal-Testing) project to analyze prenatal testing data and detect chromosomal aberrations of the fetus without invasive intervention but by analyzing free floating DNA in the bloodstream of the mother.


From a broader perspective as **Data Scientist** I have been working with large and very large datasets and custom machine learning algorithms, from design to deployment. I have been analysing Terabyte (TB) of information, in the form of deep sequencing of genetic data of thousands of individuals. Both high dimensionality and computational complexity require optimized solutions to deliver analyses in time. I acquired the right skills to improve and optimize large data systems in several domains, from health care to finance, and social media, with industrial standards.

Academic background and on site experience provided me of the most powerful theoretical and practical tools for data analysis, such as

-  Neural Networks and Deep Learning
-  Non-linear dynamics,
-  Penalised regression methods,
-  Bayesian statistics,
-  LASSO and variants,
-  and much more


## The Domestic Period 

This is a never-ending period, and the one I enjoy the most. 
As theory goes nowhere without practice, I daily experiment and build things that work. Stuff that people compile and run on real infrastructure, with real data in order to get real results. I regularly maintain a number of computing units and experiment with cutting edge technology with a **doing-not-just-reading** approach.
Hence the most important skills I have acquired across the years comprise 

### OS and Programming Languages

- GNU/Linux operating system, HP-UX
- C/C++, PHP, SQL, Perl, Lisp
- Python, R, Java

### Computing Infrastructure
- Virtualization technology,
- Amazon Web Service (AWS), 
- Spark, 
- Hadoop, 
- and designing of large information systems for the enterprise.

I am also a full stack engineer, who enjoys designing and developing products from scratch, or improving them if they exist. I particularly feel attached to this period of my life as it always allowed me to do stuff that matters, minimizing talks, meetings and distractions of any sort. It is quite a satisfaction to see progress in the form of a growing code repositories, new features and less issues, taking care of the little details by myself.

Last but not least I do ultra marathons on the distances of 55 and 80 km. The passion for running forces me to spend quite some time in the forest or on the road, where I enjoy to think while running. You can read some of my running adventures on [gipsyrunner](http://www.gipsyrunner.com).
