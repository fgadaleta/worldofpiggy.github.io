title: Algorithm Design
description: Designing algorithms is what I have been doing in the last 10 years and more. I can set up data analytics solutions for small and large enterprises and apply machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and trends, extract knowledge and support decisions within several commercial domains, from finance, healthcare, traffic, and sales forecasting. I design and deploy algorithms and cloud-based software systems for production environments with high industrial standards. I am usually glad to help. Feel free to contact me.
