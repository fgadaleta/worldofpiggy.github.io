Will robots help us take over other planets? Not quite yet, but this is the message you get on [Italian
newspapers](http://www.ansa.it/scienza/notizie/rubriche/tecnologie/2015/08/07
/sciami-di-robot-per-colonizzare-pianeti-_3671bc32-d75b-
43e2-9822-aaf1f4823001.html)Â  about this [article
](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004273).

However, the real story is told to us by Science Magazine. So what is all this
fuss about robots? Well, this study tried to bridge between **self-
organization** and **evolution**. **Self-organization** is the science that
studies how collective phenomena (bees swarming, bird flocking, slime mold
forming patterns, etc ...) are induced by simple elemental rules at the
individual level. **Evolution** is ... well ... the study of evolution.

Models of evolution have been normally used to explain the emergence and
combination of very simple traits, neglecting often self-organization that,
when studied together with evolution, can explain significant fitness boosts
that would not appear without it.

On the quest to explain how complex self-organizing phenomena evolve, a group
of scientists has been able to replicate through realistic simulation the
evolution of self-organized division of labour. They modeled a scenario very
similar to the one where atta leaf-cutter ants are involved. They used a
special type of evolutionary computation approach called **grammatical
evolution** to find the individual-level rules that yield to this type of
organization.

Although pointing at the similarities between their model and biological
systems, the same scientists also admitted that there are many key
differences, first being evolutionary computation being only inspired by
natural evolution and not modeling exactly that.

Future work aims at using more realistic evolutionary processes, while
simplifying/sacryficing the robotics part.

The robot, ehm... the man behind all this is scientist (and friend) Dr. Eliseo
Ferrante.
