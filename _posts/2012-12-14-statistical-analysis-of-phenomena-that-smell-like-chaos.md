The magics and the reality of predictions applied to markets and the stock exchange.

---

I am not saying something terribly new when I speak about predictions as a
cool task but also an extremely difficult one. Scientists want to predict
everything, from the weather to the outcome of political elections, from
disease prognosis to economy. There is a very large list of predictions that
are revealed to be poor if not completely wrong. Some of them are even
ridiculous. But scientists keep predicting things. Or at least they keep
trying to. 

Good thing is that a lot of math is usually involved even when
the problem seems to be solvable with simpler models.  What makes a prediction
method good is often the set of assumptions that one starts with. Keeping
these assumptions as close as possible to what really happens in the physical
world usually leads to a more complicated model. 

The other extreme is relaxing excessively these assumptions, something that can 
lead to oversimplifying the model and therefore limiting its power or 
misinterpreting the results. 

I recently attended a speech by[ JP Bouchaud ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-
Philippe_Bouchaud) about "[The (unfortunate) complexity of economic
systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0805)" which, aroused my interest inspired
me in the topic. 

Despite the applicability of methods borrowed from physics,
the attempt to explain the complexity of our economy with science is
challenging. It is even more so, when the assumptions nobody starts with are
about the consistent human factor in the (stochastic?) process of price
change. The questions that Bouchaud and many others are trying to answer are
"how do stock prices increase?", "what is their dynamics?" 

Answering such questions can be as fundamental as becoming super rich (for a market
speculator), eventually mitigating economical crashes or, say, keeping the
quality of life at a decent level for as many people as possible, for those
who still care about ethics. 

What Bouchaud confirmed in his speech is that the 

> erratic dynamics of markets are mostly endogenous and not exogenous, as one
might expect. 

This literally translates to the fact that no big news should be needed to change stock prices and
determine huge profits. 
A sign of the complexity of the system is given by the
very high sensitivity to small changes. 

This in particular reminds me of
catastrophic systems, in which a small change of some parameter leads to
consistent changes within the system (due to the transition from one
equilibrium to another). 

An interesting observation is that while exogenous
driving forces are stable, regular and steady, the resulting system dynamics
is complex and intermittent. Intermittent phenomena are another sign of what
mathematicians like [Prof. Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/) would
define as **Chaos**. 

Another observation of Mr Bouchaud that made me curious is
regarding the collective nature of decisions taken by traders

>if each trader is also influenced by what the rest of the community is doing, the overall
system  will jump from optimistic - buy - to pessimistic - sell - behaviour
(or the other way) even in the case of regular exogenous factors. 

An explanation of the current crisis, leads back to the years before 2007, when
banks were making debt on debt. According to the [efficient
market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) theory this
system should have corrected itself. But as we all know, that was not the
case. 

One possible reason for such a phenomenon could be that collective
euphoria concealed the negative aspects of what was going on and brought the
system to a state in which a little tiny, even irrelevant, news would have
given rise to a global crash. And it did. Rather than statistics, I see the
footprints of [catastrophe theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_theory) again.

Another study that confirms, via a numerical model, Bouchaud’s views, 
is one titled "[Unstable price dynamics as a result of information absorption in speculative markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6695)". 

The authors of the work state that when the system is close to the point of perfect
balance or critical point - that is when prices are converging to a stable value - noise can lead to
instability. Susceptibility to noise increases dramatically near the critical
point. This usually occurs when no news, capable of driving price
oscillations, is left to be exploited. Basically, if the price is too low,
traders will increase buy orders, until the price of the stock begins to rise.


As long as traders are searching for patterns in the price dynamics, they
assume that the market will respond to available information. If there is no
such information left apart from noise, as is the case near equilibria,
traders will search for patterns into noise. This will lead them to react to
random fluctuations and take decisions that might cause significant price
variations. With the aforementioned numerical model, the occurrence of such a
behaviour becomes quite evident: as the market price approaches an
equilibrium, once all predictable information has been exploited by
speculators, a little perturbation of the price (or noise) can lead to an
unforeseen price change. Since the market is not well adapted to this new
state, extremely large price changes can appear very frequently. 


> ...when prices are converging to a stable value - noise can lead to

Another key observation about the stylised agent-based model, is that large returns are
caused by endogenous information states that appeared less recently. Such
phenomenon could be interpreted by the presence of unexpected news. Despite
the time dependency of endogenous information, it might be interesting to
explain the complexity of stock price fluctuations with chaos theory. 

For instance, what if this sensitivity to noise were just a strange attractor?
Surely, price fluctuations would still appear random, but within an
[attractor](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjnvvT7-MjQAhXFSxoKHYshBQcQFgggMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elliottfractals.com%2Fwebinar_one.ppt&usg=AFQjCNETZ3Onn8GX1pY2GuIfK1HuiQWuIw&sig2=s1IgXzDM974Y2oq1GewtUQ). 

In light of these insights, approaching the problem of price or trend prediction with a merely 
statistical approach can limit place limitations on the reliability of the results. 

Provided that the market can be predicted - and there are already serious doubts about that
- mathematical statistics might not be sufficiently powerful for this purpose.
