Word embeddings is one of the most powerful concepts of deep learning applied to Natural Language Processing. 
Any word of a dictionary (the set of words recognized for the specific task) is basically transformed into a numeric vector of
a certain number of dimensions. All the rest, classification, semantic analysis, etc. is done from the aforementioned vectors 
on.

Here is a slide that explains this with a bit of algebra and some user friendly text.
