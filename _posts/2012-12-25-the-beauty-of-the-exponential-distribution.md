## Problem description

Things break. 

Well, let me put it more softly: everything has a finite
lifetime. 

Good thing is that mathematical statistics can help making light about that amount of time. 

A problem I was dealing with recently made me think about how wonderful the exponential distribution is to model things that break. 

Given the lifetime of an object by a random variable $$X \sim F$$ where $$F$$ is an unknown cumulative distribution function and $$ f$$ represents its density function, we can define the risk function - that gives
the intensity of the rupture - as $$\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\lambda(t), s=2$$.

Basically, what this ratio says 

$$ P(X \in (t,t+dt)|X>t) = \frac{P(X \in (t+dt), X>t)}{P(X>t)}=\frac{P(X \in (t,t+dt))}{1-F(t)}, s=2$$ 

The formula above can be approximated with 

$$\frac{f(t) dt}{1-F(t)} = \lambda(t) dt, s=2$$, 

that is the conditional density that something will break right after time $$ t$$. 

And now comes the trick. 

Imagine $$ X$$ is a random variable from an exponential distribution (its density function is given by

$$ f(x) = \lambda e^{(- \lambda x)}, s=2$$ , $$ x\ge 0, s=1$$), then 

$$ \lambda (t) = \frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = s=2$  $$ \frac{ \lambda e^{(- \lambda t)}{1-1+ e^{(- \lambda t)}}} = s = 2$$, 

that is the parameter of the exponential distribution indeed. This parameter is usually provided by the
vendor of the object that is going to break.  It can be a number or even an
equation with some other parameters. The problem is how to determine $$ F $$ from parameter $$ \lambda $$. 

And there we go: 

$$ \lambda (s) = \frac{f(s)}{1- F(s)} = \frac{F'(s)}{1-F(s)}= - \frac{d}{ds} log(1-F(s)), s=2$$

Integrating both members of the equation above, we get 

$$ \int_0^t \lambda (s) ds = - log(1-F(t)) + log(1-F(0)) = s=2$$ $$ -log(1-F(t)), s=1$$, $$ 1-F(t) = e^{(\int_0^t \lambda(s) ds)}, s=2$$ 

Therefore $$ F(t) = 1 - e^{( \int_0^t \lambda(s) ds)}, s=2$$ et voila'. 


## Conclusion

By knowing parameter $$ \lambda $$ it is possible to calculate the cumulative
distribution function and therefore the density function (by its derivative)
of the random variable that indicates the lifetime of the object we want to
estimate.
