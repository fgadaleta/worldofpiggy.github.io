Talking about security of communication and privacy is never enough, especially when
political instabilities are driving leaders towards decisions that will affect people on
a global scale. Those who expect to read about data science and machine learning in this
post shall postpone their wish to the next post, being the content of this one equally
important, if not more.

In this episode I advice software and habits that we should all get as soon as we can to
protect communications with friends, colleagues, and co-workers.

Walls can talk!
