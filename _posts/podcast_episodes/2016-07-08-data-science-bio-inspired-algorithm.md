In this episode I meet Dr. Eliseo Ferrante, formerly at the University of Leuven, currently researcher at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne, who studies self-organization and evolution. His academic page here. 
As we were digging into the details of his research, some analogies with data science and data analytics got my attention. 
As always, some interesting articles and media coverage are reported below.

Enjoy the show to find out more!
