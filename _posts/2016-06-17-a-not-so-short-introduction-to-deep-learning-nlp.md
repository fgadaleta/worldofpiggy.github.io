I collected some thoughts and findings about the magics of Deep Learning
applied to text analytic, with main focus on generative models and word
embeddings. I also played with some code and paved the way to my next toy, I
will present soon ;) 

Feel free to share! 

Enjoy the presentation and get in touch if needed.
