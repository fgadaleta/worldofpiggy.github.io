DISCLAIMER
The views reported in this blog are our personal opinions (still, Piggyâ€™s and mine).

Here we are, Piggy and I. We share one room, a number of books, and of course problems and possible solutions. We read about data, math, stats, and computers, and we make things.
We see science in every day life. We just love it.

## My history

With this said. Who am I? Feel free to take some time to know me or just skip straight to the content (probably more interesting than my achievements ðŸ˜‰
If you havenâ€™t skipped, I am Francesco Gadaleta, Ph.D â€“ Data Scientist. Francesco GadaletaI am currently employed as Data Scientist in the Advanced Analytics Team of Johnson&Johnson

### The Academic Phase
As former member of the Statistical Genetics Unit at the Montefiore Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of LiÃ¨ge, I have been involved in the FNRS Granted Integromics project to integrate heterogeneous omics data within a common framework.

### The Research Hospital Phase

As researcher at the Department of Human Genetics at the University Hospital UZ  Leuven, I focused on the analysis of array CGH and Next Generation Sequencing data in molecular diagnostics. I have been specifically involved in a project related to the analysis of prenatal testing data NIPT in Belgium.

From a broader perspective as Data Scientist I have been working with large and very large datasets and custom machine learning algorithms, from design to deployment. Pragmatic? Yes, I have been analysing Terabyte (TB) of information, in the form of deep sequencing data of thousands of individuals.
Both high dimensionality and computational complexity require optimized solutions to deliver analyses in time. I acquired the right skills to improve and optimize large data systems in several domains, from health care to finance, and social media, with industrial standards.
Academic background and on site experience provided me of the most powerful theoretical and practical tools for data analysis, such as

  -  Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  -  Non-linear dynamics,
  -  Penalised regression methods,
  -  Bayesian statistics,
  -  LASSO and variants,
  -  and much more

### The Pragmatic Phase 

Theory goes nowhere without practice. Hence the most important skills I have acquired across the years comprise GNU/Linux, PHP, SQL, Amazon Web Service (AWS), R and Python, Perl, C/C++, Java, Spark, Hadoop and designing of large information systems for the enterprise.
