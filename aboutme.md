Here we are, Piggy and I. We share one room, a number of books, and of course problems and their solutions. We read about data, math, stats, and computers, and we make things.
We see science in every day life. We just love it!

# My story

So, who am I? 
Feel free to take some time to get to know me or just skip straight to the content (probably more interesting than my achievements) ðŸ˜‰

I am Francesco Gadaleta, Ph.D â€“ Data Scientist formerly at several universities, then at a research hospital and currently member of the Advanced Analytics Team of Johnson&Johnson.
I received my first computer back in 1988, and at the age of seven I started exploring the quite limited capabilities of the BASIC language. After that I switched to ANSI C.
The passion for math and computer programming have driven my career ever since. There are three major periods that formed me: the Academic, the Pragmatic and the Domestic.

## The Academic Period
As former member of the Statistical Genetics Unit at the Montefiore Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of LiÃ¨ge, I have been involved in the FNRS Granted Integromics project and find solutions to integrate heterogeneous data (OMICS) within a common framework. In the aformentioned project I could assemble networks and merge clinical and genetic data together 
to make predictions about the risks and diseases of patients. 
Patients at that time were in the form of lab mice or synthetic individuals.


## The Pragmatic Period

As researcher at the Department of Human Genetics at the University Hospital UZ  Leuven, I focused on the analysis of array CGH and Next Generation Sequencing data in molecular diagnostics. 
I have been specifically involved in a project related to the analysis of prenatal testing data NIPT (Non-Invasive-Prenatal-Testing) in Belgium.

From a broader perspective as **Data Scientist** I have been working with large and very large datasets and custom machine learning algorithms, from design to deployment. 
I have been analysing Terabyte (TB) of information, in the form of deep sequencing data of thousands of individuals.
Both high dimensionality and computational complexity require optimized solutions to deliver analyses in time. I acquired the right skills to improve and optimize large data systems in several domains, 
from health care to finance, and social media, with industrial standards.
Academic background and on site experience provided me of the most powerful theoretical and practical tools for data analysis, such as

-  Neural Networks and Deep Learning
-  Non-linear dynamics,
-  Penalised regression methods,
-  Bayesian statistics,
-  LASSO and variants,
-  and much more


## The Domestic Period 

This is ongoing. As theory goes nowhere without practice, I daily experiment and build things that work. Stuff that people compile and run on real infrastructure, with real data and get real results.
Hence the most important skills I have acquired across the years comprise 

### OS and Programming Languages

- GNU/Linux operating system, HP-UX
- C/C++, PHP, SQL, Perl, Lisp
- Python, R, Java,

### Computing Infrastructure
- Virtualization technology,
- Amazon Web Service (AWS), 
- Spark, 
- Hadoop, 
- and designing of large information systems for the enterprise.
