Here we are, Piggy and I. We share one room, a number of books, and of course problems and their solutions. We read about data, math, stats, and computers, and we make things.
We see science in every day life. We just love it!

# My story

So, let's get serious. Or should we? 
Feel free to take some time to get to know me.

I am Francesco Gadaleta, Ph.D – Data Scientist and Machine Learning expert. I also worked as clinical data scientist at Gasthuisberg Research Hospital (Belgium). I am currently member of the Advanced Analytics Team of Johnson&Johnson.

I received my first computer back in 1988, and at the age of seven I started exploring the quite limited capabilities of the BASIC language. After that I switched to ANSI C. The passion for math and computer programming has been driving my career ever since. 
There are three major periods that formed me: the Academic, the Pragmatic and the Domestic.

## The Academic Period
I graduated in Computer Engineering MSc. at Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and developed an autonomous hexapod robot that could see and avoid obstacles without stereoscopic vision. Cameras at that time were pretty expensive.

Then I completed the PhD program at the University of Leuven, developing virtualization based solutions to protect operating systems from serious attacks to their kernel. During the PhD I have been travelling extensively to present an innovative approach to computer security with hypervisor technology. Here is my [dissertation](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/413219/1/phd+dissertation.pdf)


As former member of the Statistical Genetics Unit at the Montefiore Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Liège, I have been involved in the FNRS Granted Integromics project with the purpose of finding solutions to integrate heterogeneous data (OMICS) within a common framework. In the aformentioned project I could assemble networks and merge clinical and genetic data together to make predictions about the risk of diseases for patients before the disease could be observed by the known symptoms. 



## The Pragmatic Period

As data scientist at the Department of Human Genetics at the University Hospital UZ Leuven, I focused on the analysis of array CGH and Next Generation Sequencing data in molecular diagnostics. I have been specifically involved in the NIPT (Non-Invasive-Prenatal-Testing) project to analyze prenatal testing data and detect chromosomal aberrations of the fetus without invasive intervention but by analyzing free floating DNA in the bloodstream of the mother.


From a broader perspective as **Data Scientist** I have been working with large and very large datasets and custom machine learning algorithms, from design to deployment. I have been analysing Terabyte (TB) of information, in the form of deep sequencing data of thousands of individuals. Both high dimensionality and computational complexity require optimized solutions to deliver analyses in time. I acquired the right skills to improve and optimize large data systems in several domains, 
from health care to finance, and social media, with industrial standards.
Academic background and on site experience provided me of the most powerful theoretical and practical tools for data analysis, such as

-  Neural Networks and Deep Learning
-  Non-linear dynamics,
-  Penalised regression methods,
-  Bayesian statistics,
-  LASSO and variants,
-  and much more


## The Domestic Period 

This is a never-ending period. 
As theory goes nowhere without practice, I daily experiment and build things that work. Stuff that people compile and run on real infrastructure, with real data in order to get real results. I regularly maintain a number of computing units and experiment with cutting edge technology with **doing-not-just-reading** approach.
Hence the most important skills I have acquired across the years comprise 

### OS and Programming Languages

- GNU/Linux operating system, HP-UX
- C/C++, PHP, SQL, Perl, Lisp
- Python, R, Java

### Computing Infrastructure
- Virtualization technology,
- Amazon Web Service (AWS), 
- Spark, 
- Hadoop, 
- and designing of large information systems for the enterprise.
